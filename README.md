# Nix Docker Test

This is a very simple repo I made to play around with building
[Layered Docker images](https://ryantm.github.io/nixpkgs/builders/images/dockertools/#ssec-pkgs-dockerTools-buildLayeredImage)
using [Nix](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works/) as detailed in [this blog post](https://xeiaso.net/talks/2024/nix-docker-build/) by Xe Iaso.

It is also an excuse for me to practice using [Jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj)
for version control, as can be inferred from the dev shell definition in `flake.nix`.
